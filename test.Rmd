## Introducing R
If you don't have R Studio already installed on your computer, please download and install it.

To check if you already have it- On Windows computers, please type 'windows' button followed by the letter 'r'. R Studio app will be listed. If it's not listed here, it's time to download R and R Studio now.

To Download R Studio, you need to download R package and R Studio both. 
First download R- Please google "Download R Studio". It will take you to the link <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>. Click on the R STudio Desktop Free "Download". 


Please download 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
